# Expense-Tracker-Visualization
This project, Expense Tracker Visualization, is built using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize spending data based on different payment modes. It reads transaction data from an Excel file (sales_data.xlsx), groups the data by payment method, and calculates the total amount spent in each category. Additionally, it lists the products purchased under each payment mode. A customized bar chart is generated to visually represent the total expenses, with value labels on each bar and color styling to enhance readability. The final output includes a visual chart saved as Expense_Tracker.png and the summarized data exported to both Expense_Tracker.csv and Expense_Tracker.xlsx for further use or reporting.
